# Permalist-To-Do-App
A permanent to-do list app is a web application that allows users to create, manage, and track tasks in an organized manner. It ensures that user-created tasks are saved permanently in a database (Postgres SQL) so that they can be retrieved and managed over time, even after the application is closed or refreshed.
